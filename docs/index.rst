pycatia documentation
=====================

pycatia is a python module for interfacing with the CATIA Automation COM object.

I could not find a solution using python to access some of the CATIA Automation methods of the CATIAMeasurable object.
After much googling I discovered a solution and decided to create this python API. Currently this module covers all
functionality of the SpaceAnalysisInterfaces CATIAMeasurable / Measurable object and partial coverage of other
Automation objects.

See the examples section for how to use this module.
